Hello all and welcome to my first blog post!  I began my journey to learn how to code just a few weeks ago, and I plan to write some posts along the way to share my experience with fellow coders.  

A little about me to start us off: I graduate from Cornell University in 2017 with a major in Applied Economics & Management and a minor in Biometry & Statistics. I currently live in NYC working as a Senior Research Analyst for Nielsen. In my free time, I love to be active, pushing myself hard at the gym or training for my next race (so far I've ran a Spartan Race, 2 half marathons, and a Ragnar Race. I can't wait to start training for a new race soon!). I also am a big foodie and enjoy finding new great restaurants to try! 

I have never been much of a technology person. I know all of the basic features on say a computer, tv, or cellphone, but I am not usually one to explore any more unusual tricks or extra elements.  When it comes to technology, I'm usually the one asking for help rather than giving help.  So it may seem a bit unusual that I have decided to dive head first into learning how to code.  

To be honest, I was definitely nervous when I started to think about taking a coding class. Will I understand what's going on? Will I be able to keep up? Will I actually learn to code?  While all of these thoughts scared me a bit, I was ready to take on the challenge. With all of the focus on technology in today's world, I feel like coding is a great skill to have. Especially since I work in data analytics, learning to code just seemed like the right next step to help me advance my career.  And since I am still early in my career, now seems like a good time to push myself and try something new. 

While I know this will not be an easy journey, I am hoping that I can carry over the tenacity I have when training for a race into learning how to code. I want to prove to myself that I can do something I never thought I would be able to do. I am very excited to see what I can accomplish with this course and I can't wait to soon become a proficient coder!
