<p>I am a Cornell University graduate with a background in business and statistics. I am currently working as a Senior Research Analyst for Nielsen, doing a mix of data analytics and consulting for new product innovations.  As a data analyst, I feel like learning how to code would complement my current analytical skills very well, so I have decided to take up learning how to code with a data science focus .  Outside of work and coding, I love to be physically active and push my boundaries. Over the past few years, I have completed a Spartan Race, 2 half marathons, and a Ragnar Race (I ran a total of 16 miles through the woods and through the night!).  I can't wait to start training for a new race soon!</p>
