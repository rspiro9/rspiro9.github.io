<p>I am a Cornell University graduate with a background in business and statistics. I am currently working in NYC doing a mix of data analytics and consulting.  In my free time, I have always been very active and I love to push my boundaries. This has led to my interested in training for races. So far, I have completed a Spartan Race, 2 half marathons, and a Ragnar Race (I ran a total of 16 miles through the woods and through the night!).  I can't wait to start training for a new race soon!</p>
